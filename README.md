# odometer-reading-detection-yolov5-paddleOCR-streamlit
This is an webapp which can detect odometer readings from Vehicle Dashboard. It utilizes YOLOv5 to localize the odometer reading region. After that using paddleOCR the value of odometer reading is extracted. The model (YOLOv5) has been custom trained on vehicle dashboard images. The webapp is created using Streamlit.
